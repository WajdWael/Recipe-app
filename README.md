Vist site => https://wajdwael.github.io/Recipe-app/

## It was so funny to build...

It's really amazing to build a website using reactJS because it gives a really fantastic user experience! so I highly encourage you to start learning it and using it in your projects!

### Tools:

- React.js
- JavaScript
- CSS/HTML
- JSX
- Git/GitHub
- APIs
- styled - (To write css code inside the react app)
- motion (To add some animation in the website)

#### What did I earn out of this project?
> The main thing I have learned from this project is **APIs**, I learned how to request them and apply them to my website. How to render the data and filter them by using functionalities also I used styled.js to write my CSS it was my first try for it but after this try, I fell in love with it and I started using it almost with every react project all that because it features it enables me to use sass/scss features and to write JS logic within the styles! What a fantastic tool. Lastly, I used motion To add some animation on the website to make it smooth.
